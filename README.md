# Rare-Event-Simulation-for-Stochastic-Programming
Rare-Event Simulation for Stochastic Programming experiments
The main code is in simulate_uniform.ipynb, simulation_normal.ipynb and simulation_beta.ipynb. The figures in the report are generated from other files, but the algorithms are still the same. 
The implementation needs Xpress package. So download Xpress before you run the code. And please modify the first part of the code for all files for your computer.
